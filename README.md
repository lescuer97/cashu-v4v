_Don't be reckless:_ This project is in early development; it does, however, work with real sats! Always use amounts you don't mind losing.

# cashu-v4v

This has now been turned into an attempt at a Golang reference implementation of the Cashu Protocol and a SvelteKit wallet for it. Initially, this was a project to create a value-for-value wallet with Cashu at its core.

## Purpose of this project

This is just an attempt to learn Go. I saw the work made by calle on the Cashu protocol and was fascinated by the awesomeness of the project. So I decided to make a reference implementation of the mint in Go. I am attempting to make all the NUTs available as well as some other ideas such as: Monero ECash token.

The wallet is going to be made with SvelteKit (probably not the best option). I will implement the wallet with the possibility of multiple denominations of eCash (SATs, Monero, eUSD). I would also like to have some Nostr functionality.

## Implemented Nuts

## Development

Right now, the wallet and the mint are being developed as completely separate projects.
